## Todo List project

This is my project which is part of Modern JS Complete Course by NetNinja. To do this profect I used 
- HTML
- CSS

In this project we can add and remove elements to the list. Additionally we can filter our todo list. 

When website starts and when you add element to the list - you can see the **animation in CSS**
